  notes={First, shows that single Hill-type motor model for muscles does not predict variability $\propto$ force, but multiple parallel Hill-type motors do; two types: ITM, where all motor units act on the same center, and DTM where all motor units connect on the same tendon. Cc suppresses variability, except at low levels; this creates a peak that moves depending on inertia. DTM/ITM gives same forces but different kinematic variability/impedance}

  notes={shows that co-contraction improves learning rate in force field in a channel adaptation task with respect to no-co-contraction group and control group. Hypothesis is that it is because it reduces kinematic errors so the internal model can be fit better. Note that co-contraction increases EMG noise (this was analyzed in other papers as well). Shows also the co-contraction is reduced as learning progresses.}

Moreover, the learned disturbance is extrapolated using basis functions related to joints and muscles (i.e., sensors and actuators).}

Cocontraction is defined as the minumum normalized muscle activity at each sample time. Intent is defined as instructions given to the user: "relax", "move to target", "hold position". Say that difference in cc level across intent states was statistically significant, but plots are less clear. Show that cc levels change throughout phases of the task.}
